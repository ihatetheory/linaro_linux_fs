* Missing features in GtkHTML the renderer
------------------------------------------

- Cursor keys do not work with the scrollbars.

- Numbered lists are not implemented.

- The HTML non-editing component is not finished.

- Table captions are not supported.

* Missing features in GtkHTML the editor
----------------------------------------

- We need hooks to edit links.

- We need a command to turn a whole region into a link.

- Keybindings should be somewhat configurable.

- The horizontal size of the document is not updated correctly if the
  minimum size of the current edited line becomes larger than it.

- File names entered in text fields through GTK GUI come to us as
  UTF-8. They should be converted to the locale file name encoding
  (see g_get_filename_charsets()) using g_filename_from_utf8() before
  attempting to open the file. As to what encoding to use in the URIs
  in HTML, there are two choices, either use UTF-8 or the locale file
  name encoding. Maybe it should be an option? Most modern Linux
  distributions presumably use UTF-8 if freshly installed, but there
  are loads of sites where legacy charsets like ISO-8859-1 still are
  used. (Note that on Windows, GLib provides an UTF-8 API, including
  the gstdio wrappers, even though the C library uses system codepage
  for file names (or UTF-16, if you use the wchar_t versions.)

- If editing an HTML file loaded (or already saved at least once) where
  we thus know its location in the file system, pathnames for images,
  background pixmaps, and links that point to files in the same file
  system subtree should be automatically converted to relative URIs
  instead of full absolute path file: URIs. That would be much more
  useful.
