  <title>Jabber account details</title>

  <p>Most Jabber accounts will require only a login ID and a password
  to connect.  For some accounts or on certain types of networks, you
  may need to enter additional information in the <gui>Advanced</gui>
  section.  Normally, you will not need to use the advanced options
  below.  For general instructions on adding an account, see
  <link xref="add-account"/>.</p>

  <note>
    <p>Google Talk is a type of Jabber account.  These instructions
    hold for Google Talk accounts as well.</p>

      <title><gui>Encryption required (TLS/SSL)</gui></title>
      <title><gui>Ignore SSL certificate errors</gui></title>
      <p>Whenever possible, communication between <app>Empathy</app> and
      the Jabber server is encrypted.  If encrypted communication is not
      possible, messages may be sent unencrypted.  Select <gui>Encryption
      required</gui> to prevent <app>Empathy</app> from communicating with
      the Jabber server when encryption is not possible.</p>
      <p>Some Jabber servers may encrypt data using invalid certificates,
      or using certificates signed by unknown authorities.  You can select
      <gui>Ignore SSL certificate errors</gui> to allow encrypted communication
      with invalid certificates, but this allows an attacker to intercept your
      communication with the server (including your password). You might want to
      use this option for testing purposes, or if your server is broken and you
      do not care about the security of your communication.</p>

      <title><gui>Resource</gui></title>
      <title><gui>Priority</gui></title>
      <p>If you have multiple applications (for instance, on separate computers)
      connected to your account at the same time, you can set a resource to
      uniquely identify each one.  By default, <app>Empathy</app> will use
      <input>Telepathy</input> as the resource.</p>
      <p>You can set the priority to specify which application should receive
      incoming messages from your contacts.  New messages will be sent to the
      application with the highest priority.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title><gui>Override server settings</gui></title>
      <p><app>Empathy</app> will use default settings to connect to the
      Jabber server based on your login ID.  For some Jabber servers, you
      will need to enter custom server settings manually.  These settings
      should be provided for you by your Jabber provider.</p>
